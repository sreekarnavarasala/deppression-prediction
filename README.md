# Depression Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting depression using various machine learning algorithms. It explores the effectiveness of different models and techniques for analyzing healthcare data to identify individuals at risk of depression.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for depression prediction, leveraging a dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and medical history information. The primary goals include:

-   **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Understanding the dataset characteristics, handling missing values, and preparing data for model training.
    
-   **Model Selection and Training:** Evaluating different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) and optimizing their hyperparameters.
    
-   **Model Evaluation and Comparison:** Assessing the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    
-   **Feature Engineering and Selection:** Investigating feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
    
-   **Addressing Class Imbalance:** Implementing strategies to mitigate the issue of class imbalance in the dataset.
    
-   **Deployment and Visualization:** Exploring potential deployment methods and creating insightful visualizations of the results.
